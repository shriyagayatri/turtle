# Fractal

In mathematics, a fractal is a detailed, recursive, and infinitely self-similar mathematical set whose Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension and which is encountered ubiquitously in nature. Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry. (Source-Wikipedia)
